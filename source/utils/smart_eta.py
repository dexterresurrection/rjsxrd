"""Smart ETA estimator for semaphore-constrained batch testing.

Designed for 30k-100k configs at concurrency 150-300. Combines three
estimates (window rate, global rate, duration-based) and picks the
most conservative to avoid the "fast configs finish first" bias.

Key improvements over earlier versions:
- Larger window (up to 10% of total, min 500) for stable rate at scale
- EMA of per-config duration updates every completion (not just per batch)
- Three-way estimate + timeout floor clamp
- No confusing floor multiplier (removed the 0.8 discount)
- Conservative by default: overestimate rather than underestimate

class SmartETA:
    """ETA estimator for semaphore-constrained batch testing at scale.

    Core insight: with 30k-100k configs and 300 concurrency, the sliding
    window alone adapts too slowly when fast configs finish and slow ones
    remain. This class combines three estimates and picks the worst (most
    conservative) to avoid the "looks fast but has hours left" trap.

    Thread-safe via atomic single-append operations on deques and a lock
    for the shared completion counter.
