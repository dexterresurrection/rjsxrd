"""Single shared registry for spawned Xray processes and proxy monitors.

Before this module existed, there were three competing registries:
- _active_testers (xray_tester.py) — list of XrayTester instances
- _xray_process_registry (ip_verifier.py) — list of (tester, process) tuples
- _active_proxy_monitors (proxy_monitor.py) — module-level list of ProxyMonitor

Each had its own atexit handler and its own signal handler. Result:
- a tester created by ip_verifier was in BOTH _active_testers and _xray_process_registry
- SIGINT cleanup could fire one handler and miss the other

The fix: a single ProcessRegistry class. xray_tester, ip_verifier, and
proxy_monitor all use it. Cleanup is centralized. atexit and signal handling
live here too (so they don't fight each other).

    the signal handler can stop monitors before terminating xray processes.
    Monitor cleanup runs BEFORE process cleanup in the signal handler order
    (monitors depend on SOCKS ports that dying xray processes provide).

    Each entry represents a spawned Xray subprocess plus the tester that
    spawned it (so cleanup can call the tester's per-process stop method
    which handles things like psutil-based port tracking).

    Thread-safety: every mutator is protected by a lock. The cleanup methods
    iterate over a snapshot (entries[:]) so concurrent additions don't
    affect the cleanup pass.
